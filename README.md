# DSA_Project : Stack and Queue using Linked List
# Project Overview :
This project demonstrates the implementation of two fundamental data structures, Stack and Queue, using linked lists. By leveraging linked lists, we avoid the fixed size limitations of arrays, making our implementations dynamic and efficient. This project also reinforces key concepts in data structures and algorithms.

# How to Run the Program
1) **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JehangirFaiz/DSA_Project
cd DSA_Project
strack.py
Queue.py
```
# The purpose of the code:
The purpose of this project is to implement the Stack and Queue data structures using linked lists. This implementation highlights the dynamic and flexible nature of linked lists while providing hands-on practice with essential operations of these data structures.

# Stack Implementation:
The Stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. It is implemented using a singly linked list and provides the following operations:

``push(data):`` Adds an element to the top of the stack.

``pop():`` Removes and returns the top element of the stack.

``peek():`` Returns the top element without removing it.

``is_empty():`` Checks if the stack is empty.

``display():`` Displays all elements in the stack.

# Time Complexity:

``Push (push(data)):`` O(1)

``Pop (pop()):`` O(1)

``Peek (peek()):`` O(1)

``Check Empty (is_empty()):`` O(1)

``Display (display())``: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stack.


# Queue Implementation:
The Queue follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. It is implemented using a singly linked list and provides the following operations:

``enqueue(data)``: Adds an element to the end of the queue.

``dequeue():`` Removes and returns the front element of the queue.

``is_empty():`` Checks if the queue is empty.

``display():`` Displays all elements in the queue.

# Time Complexity :

``Enqueue (enqueue(data)):`` O(1)

``Dequeue (dequeue()):`` O(1)

``Check Empty (is_empty()):`` O(1)

``Display (display()):`` O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue.
